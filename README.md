# ETL_Mini_Project_GBerenjian_NJamal_NGrewal


## Overview
This project is an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) Mini Project designed to practice building an ETL pipeline using Python, Pandas, and additional tools such as Python dictionary methods or regular expressions. The goal is to extract, transform, and load data into a Postgres database through the following steps:

1. Extract and Transform:
- Extract raw data using Python and clean or transform it using Pandas.
- Use either Python dictionary methods or regular expressions to process the data.

2. CSV File Creation:
- Generate four CSV files from the transformed data.

3. Database Integration:
- Design an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD).
- Create a table schema for the database.
- Load the data into a Postgres database.

## Technologies Used
This project leverages several technologies to process and analyze election data efficiently:

- **Python**: The core language used for scripting the analysis, providing robust support for data manipulation and file handling.
- **Pandas**: A powerful library for data manipulation and analysis, used to handle, clean, and analyze the school and student data effectively.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: An interactive computing environment that facilitates data exploration, visualization, and narrative analysis, making it easy to document and present findings.
- **SQL**: Used for querying, manipulating, and analyzing data within the database.
- **PostgreSQL**: The relational database management system (RDBMS) selected to create, store, and manage the structured data imported from CSV files.
- **pgAdmin**: Provides a user-friendly interface for managing PostgreSQL databases, executing SQL queries, and visualizing database schema and data.
- **Quick Database Diagrams**: Utilized to create the data model, visually representing the relationships between tables and helping design the database structure.
- **Visual Studio Code**: Chosen as the preferred Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for coding, debugging, and managing the project files.
- **GitHub**: Hosts the repository online, allowing for backup, sharing, and documentation hosting, including this README file.
